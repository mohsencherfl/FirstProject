Not long a ago the writer of these lines 
In the mad pride of intellectuality,
Maintained "the power of words"__denied that ever
A thought arose within the human brain
Beyond the utterance of the human tongue:
And now, as if in mockery of that boast,


diviner visions;gorgeous vista;unpurpled vapors
